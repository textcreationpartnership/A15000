            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13577:55"/>And when <hi>Moſes</hi> was dead,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deu.</hi> 34.6 <hi>Iud.</hi> 9.</note> God ſent an Angel and buried him. Thus his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie regarded the buriall of the dead. And when wicked <hi>Iezabel</hi> died a moſt curſed death,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 9.34.35.36.</note> yet <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid, <hi>Viſit now yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der curſed woman, and bury her.</hi> And ſome went, but before they came, the dogges had eate her. Loe though ſhe were the curſed of God, it was thought meet, that ſhe ſhould be buried. Then I condemne the light opinions of thoſe that ſay, It is no matter what becomes of the bodie being dead; and I wiſh them to correct their folly, that denie to bury the dead: and that they would not ceaſe to doo good to them that are dead. Well, to the graue with <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> thoſe that be proud muſt come. Which in my Text I take to be ſpoken <hi>Nomine</hi> to ſcorne <hi>Pride,</hi> becauſe ſhee would be aboue the cloudes, ſhee ſhall be brought vnder the earth.

Therefore to ſome their time is ſhortned for a plague, and to ſome their daies are prolonged for a bleſſing, as God hath promiſed. And the time of death, and certaine end of mans life, is not determined.</p>
               <p>Firſt to the threatnings, as alſo to the promiſes of the bleſſings of almightie God, I anſwere, that both containe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:13577:61"/>a condition, ſometimes expreſſed in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.2.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.19.20. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.13.14.15.

According vnto which, the promiſe taketh place, whether it be of a curſe, or of a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>So that though we ſay commonly of them that kill themſelues, they ſhorten their daies, or they die before their time; indeed it ſeemeth ſo to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man. yet in the decree of God it is not ſo. But Gods iudgement was ſo determined vpon ſuch a man, and the like, with <hi>Iob</hi> his children,<note place="margin">Malum paenae.</note> before the world was.

               <p>Their long life is to them a curſe, and the ſame is their reward; the poore muſt truſt in God, for God will be their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerer, if they fight firme in faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuch wicked men haue their pleaſure in this world, to make them moſt inexcuſable, and their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſure in the life to come, with <hi>Diues.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, for the knowledge of thy end, it is not opened in the word of God, and therefore it appertaineth to his vnreuealed will, and thou muſt not ſeeke further, and buſie thy ſelfe in the ſecrets of God, as coniurers, and figure-flingers, and ſtarre-tooters doo.</p>

               <p>And therfore <hi>Mors pro remedio data eſt, quaſi finis malorum,</hi>

                  </note> Death is giuen vs for a remedie, as the end of all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, it being <hi>A vitae curis abſolutio,</hi> The abſolution fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cares of this life. And therefore carefully to be expected, and willingly imbraced, without any feare.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we haue great cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce at the comming of death, becauſe by it, we paſſe from infinite troubles, to the end of our faith, euen the ſaluation of our ſoules, long hoped for. Which is an inheritance immortall and vndeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that fadeth not away, reſerued in

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which onely riddeth away the griefes of the body. <hi>Portus eſt mortalibus mors.</hi> Of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> it is called <hi>Tranquillus por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi> Death a calme hauen for mortall men where they arriue, to behold the faire beautie of the Lord, and to viſit his Temple. In many places of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Death is called a <hi>Sleepe.</hi> Becauſe that euen as ſleepe and quiet reſt is to a painfull honeſt labouring man, at night moſt ſweete and comfortable, ſo lkewiſe is Death to a faithfull ſoule, garniſhed with good workes, like a Bride-chamber adorned, ending all things with ioy like a Comedie. And therefore why ſhould ſhe not bee wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come?</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:13577:81"/>
               <p>Thirdly, death moſt willingly wee embrace, becauſe it being come, we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to that perfection of knowledge which we do deſire, &amp; which in this life we cannot attaine vnto. All men deſire to be expert in their ſcience or profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and the Saints of God in the true knowledge of their ſaluation, and when death is come, then this is obtained. Euen then, when we ſhall all meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the vnitie of the faith, and knowledge of the ſonne of God vnto a perfect man, and vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt. Chriſt ſaith: <hi>This is life eternall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.3.</note> 
                  <hi>that they know thee to be the only very God, &amp; him whom thou haſt ſent, Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Now this knowledge we haue, being in the body, and abſent from the Lord, by faith and not by ſight. Through which, we all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold as in a myrror or glaſſe, the glory of the Lord, with open face.<note place="margin">Marl. ex Cal. in <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>13</hi>

                  <hi>Fides ergo noſtra deum nunc intuetur tanquam ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentem.</hi> Our faith therefore now doth ſee God, yet as being abſent. For wee know in part, and we propheſie in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then <hi>Id eſt poſt mortem.</hi> After death, that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13577:82"/>which is in part, ſhall be aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>Which <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle prooueth by a double argument, one taken from the example of himſelfe, the other is a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13577:82"/>Which is the truth by Chriſt himſelfe expreſſed: who ſaith, (ſpeaking of Gods deare adopted children) <hi>See that ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not one of theſe litle ones:</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Lyra. Pet. Mart. ibid.</note> doth not import an equalitie of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (betwixt God and vs) but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine likeneſſe, yet ours is far inferiour to his.<note place="margin">Marler. ex R. ibid.</note>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13577:83"/>Then know (beloued) that now in this life wee haue many ſchoolemaiſters to teach vs this imperfect knowledge of God that wee haue. As. 1. Gods creatures.

Againe, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>His eternall power and godhead, are ſeene by the creation of the world, being conſidered in his workes. Pſal.</hi> 19.1. 2.

Now all theſe ſhall ceaſe to teach vs when death comes: like the ceremonies of the lawe at the coming of Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1.9. For what needeth a candle in the cleare and open ſunne light? Then we ſhall not need to ſay one to an other, know
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:13577:83"/>the Lord, for all ſhall know him, from the leaſt vnto the greateſt. Therefore welcome death, and come Lord Ieſus, come quickly.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, though death ſet vpon thee as thine enemie, and do bring thee downe to the graue: yet ſhalt thou not feare to buckle with her, becauſe in the end thou ſhalt get the maiſtrie of her, as <hi>Michael</hi> did of the dragon. <hi>Reue.</hi> 12.9. And triumph ouer her by the power of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. through faith in the death of Chriſt.

               <p>Hypocriſie is moſt ſhamefull and damnable in mourning for the dead. Thus <hi>Herod</hi> mourned or ſeemed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, when <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt was to be behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The text ſaith: <hi>The King was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Math.</hi> 14.9. But it was but from the teeth outward. For the truth is, hee was glad that the mote was out of his eye, which would not ſuffer him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy his inceſt. Yet hee could not for ſhame, but ſeeme ſorrowfull for him whom the reſt loued. Therefore he is like to thoſe wicked women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that would gladly haue their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and fathers dead, becauſe they thinke them to bee ſome lettes vnto them to accompliſh their wicked deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Such feigne themſelues to weepe, like <hi>Tekoah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.2. but their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie hearts, without an onyon in a nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie, can wring out as many teares from their hypocriticall eyes, as iuyce from a mill-ſtone, though they grumble much

               <p>The third thing to bee auoyded in mourning for our dead, or when any croſſe is laid vpon vs, is immoderate weeping &amp; howling.

And <hi>Dauid</hi> was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be blamed, who though he mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not when his infant was dead, yet outragiouſly he lamented and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe for the death of the traitor <hi>Abſolon,</hi> that ſought to depoſe him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his kingdome. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33.

               <p>Hell is a place without the heauen, prepared of God, with vnſpeakeable, moſt horrible, confuſed, &amp; euerlaſting torments for the damned. Of which, though the extreame and full horror thereof, cannot of man bee expreſſed, no not if a damned ſoule were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to expreſſe what it could of the paine, it is not able to deſcribe that, which it moſt wofully feeleth: yet the holy ſcriptures of God do ſpeak plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſufficiently thereof, for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and inſtruction, moſt wonderfull to behold. Whereof many men haue written learnedly: the chiefe ſubſtance whereof, thou ſhalt finde collected by <hi>Parſons</hi> in his Reſolution, the ninth Chapter: vnto which for this time I will ſend you. 1. Becauſe of the truth of the argument, and the plaine &amp; eaſie maner of handling it. 2. As alſo I muſt confeſſe I cannot much amend it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now ſtay to ſpeake that which I would of it. 3. Becauſe honour is to be giuen to whom honour is due. The Idollators rob God of his honour: and he that taketh an other mans workes without his name, is like a theefe that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:13577:95"/>ſtealeth an other mans goods to enrich himſelfe.
